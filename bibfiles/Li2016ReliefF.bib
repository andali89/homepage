abstract="Complex products contain a huge number of quality characteristics (QCs). To efficiently control the manufacturing processes of complex products, identifying critical to quality characteristics (CTQs) is required. This study proposes a feature selection algorithm named ReliefF based forward selection (RFS) for CTQs identification. RFS combines ReliefF with a forward selection algorithm to handle the problem of feature (QC) redundancy. Empirical study has shown that RFS can select fewer CTQs while maintaining a high accuracy rate compared with ReliefF. The proposed algorithm is efficient in identifying CTQs.",
