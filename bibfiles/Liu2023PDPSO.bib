  abstract = "Product Portfolio Planning (PPP) is one of the most critical
              decisions for companies to gain an edge in the competitive
              market. It seeks for the optimal combination of products and
              attribute levels offered for customers in the target market,
              which is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this
              paper, a Probability-based Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization
              (PDPSO) algorithm is proposed to solve the PPP problem. In PDPSO,
              the particle is encoded as discrete values, which can be
              straightforwardly used to represent the product portfolio with
              discrete attributes. PDPSO adopts a probability-based mechanism
              to update particles. Specifically, a probability vector is used
              to decide the probability of three search behaviors, i.e.,
              learning from the personal best position, global best position,
              or random search. In experiments, the search performance of PDPSO
              has been compared with that of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a
              Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm on generated PPP problem cases
              with different sizes. The results indicate that PDPSO obtains
              significantly better optimization results than GA and SA in most
              cases and obtains desirable/near-optimal solutions on various PPP
              problem cases. A case study of notebook computer portfolio
              planning is also presented to illustrate the efficiency and
              effectiveness of PDPSO.",
